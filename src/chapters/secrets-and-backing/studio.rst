Studio: Deploy API with KeyVault
================================

In our Studio today we will be continuing with the API we have been publishing throughout the week.

Today we will be using Azure KeyVault to manage the sensitive data that is our Database connection string.

We will also need to setup a database on the VM where our API lives. We will walk you through the Database download, installation, and configuration but you will be responsible for setting up the VM, the API, and the AZ KeyVault.
