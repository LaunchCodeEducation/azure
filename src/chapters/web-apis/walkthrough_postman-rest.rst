Walkthrough: Consuming the Coding Events API With Postman
=========================================================

The UI of a browser is designed to make *simple* ``GET`` requests for URLs entered into its address bar. This design works great for browsing sites but falls short when working with headless APIs. 

Anything beyond a ``GET`` request is handled behind the scenes such as when you ``POST`` a form or through AJAX requests with JavaScript. But before you develop the client-side logic for making background requests you need a way to interact with the API server directly and understand how it works.

When exploring and testing a Web API it is invaluable to have an interactive environment that allows you to fine-tune requests. For example, you may need to configure the HTTP method, headers or body of the request -- all of which the browser does not provide a UI for.

Instead of the browser we can use tools made specifically for interacting with APIs. One of the most popular API tools in the industry is **Postman**. It is a cross-platform tool that puts you in full control of configuring and executing API requests. 

In this walkthrough we will work with Postman to explore how APIs can be consumed.

Setup
=====

Installing Postman
------------------

Installing Postman is easy thanks to its cross-platform nature. You can download the installer on `their downloads page <https://www.postman.com/downloads/>`_. We will show instructions for setting up on Windows but because Postman is cross-platform the other instructions in this walkthrough will apply regardless of your platform.

Select the ``Windows x64`` installer download then run the installer:

After installation Postman should open automatically. Making an account can be useful but if you do not want to create one you can select the **skip** link in grey at the bottom of the splash screen:

   Once installed you can right-click the Postman icon and pin it to your taskbar for easy access in the future:

You can leave the Launchpad view open for now. We will explore Postman after setting up our API server.
