Introduction to Troubleshooting
===============================

Troubleshooting is one of the most important skills to the Operations professional. 

Troubleshooting is the process of:

#. realizing an issue exists
#. identifying the issue through duplication (how and under what conditions it happens)
#. researching the potential causes of the issue
#. isolate the root cause of the issue by systematically eliminating the potential causes
#. researching a fix for the root cause of the issue
#. fixing the root cause of the issue
#. checking that the fix resolves the issue
#. communicating about the issue with others

As you can see from this list **research is a foundational aspect of troubleshooting**. After an issue has been discovered it is usually up to the Operations team to identify the issue, research the issue, and ultimately fix the issue. 

Troubleshooting skills are improved through experience. At the start of your career you won't have much knowledge of what can go wrong, and how to fix a broken deployment. However, as you continue to research and fix issues your troubleshooting skills will grow with your knowledge of potential issues.

   This chapter is in no way exhaustive, as you continue throughout your career you will learn about new techniques, tools, and solutions to issues.
   
   We will provide some opinionated guidelines to give you a foundation but eventually you will hone in on the most efficient approach for you and your team.

The following case study articles will present multiple case studies in which we will illustrate the eight troubleshooting step. The objective of the case study articles is to gain a **strong understanding of the troubleshooting process**.

The final **how to troubleshoot** article will introduce tools, methodologies, tips and tricks to help you understand how to perform the troubleshooting process.

Although development troubleshooting will be mentioned in this chapter we will primarily focus on Operations troubleshooting as that has been the focus of this Azure course.

.. admonition:: Note

   The issues throughout this chapter will be framed as issues in the Coding Events API. Many of the issues discussed may be similar, or identical, to issues you may encounter in other deployments.

To start let's build some troubleshooting knowledge by examining some case studies around issues that could arise in a Coding Events API deployment.
